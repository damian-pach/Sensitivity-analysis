# Sensitivity-analysis

Functionality that makes the sensitivity analysis faster and easier.

To add it to the project, simply drag and drop both userform files (.frm) and formulas module to the VBA Project window (**Developer -> Visual Basic**), then add a Button from Form Controls to any sheet and assign it the available **ClickMe** function.
The script automatically creates a new sheet and adapts it for the purposes of analysis.

The result of the analysis is the graph of NPV as a function of the user-selected variables, which by default changes by -50%, -15%, 15%, and 50%.

A sample file showing the functionality has been attached to the repository.
